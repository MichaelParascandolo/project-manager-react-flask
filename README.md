## Make sure node.js is installed on your computer

### node --version in your terminal

## Make sure yarn is installed on your computer (Google it)

### yarn --version in your terminal to check

## "yarn vite" starts front-end server

## "yarn start-backend" starts the back-end server

### This might not work for you..otherwise cd into 'backend' and use "flask run" in the terminal

---

## Python back-end server is not going to run after cloning it will require some setup

### Still trying to get this to work

#### This was the guide I used to get it running on my local machine
